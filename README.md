# Weather Prediction Model

## Overview
This project focuses on building a weather prediction model using a machine learning algorithm; Linear Regression. The goal is to predict weather parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, rainfall) based on historical weather data.


## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed weather data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.


## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned and processed for model training.
- **Model Training**: A machine learning model (i.e., Linear Regression) is used to predict weather parameters.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
